This project is the result of my master's thesis "Development of an educational simulator for computed tomography by implementing physical models, device components and reconstruction processes in C++".

There is no further documentation here. You can read the thesis in german language, which can be found as a .pdf file in the repo.

If you want to use the simulator you need the libraries FLTK and sciplot. There is a cmake file supplied. But I developed the program with Visual Studio Community.
